#  Book Management REST API

This is a simple RESTful API built with **Node.js** and **Express** that allows you to perform **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a list of books.  
Books are stored **in-memory**, meaning data is lost when the server restarts. Ideal for learning and testing RESTful APIs.
